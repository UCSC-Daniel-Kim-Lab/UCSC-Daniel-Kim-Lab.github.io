  short: Studying the noncoding transcriptome to develop RNA liquid biopsy technology for precision health and early detection of diseases.
  long: Over 75% of the 3 billion base pairs in our genome are transcribed into RNA, yet only 1-2% are translated into proteins. Our lab investigates this noncoding RNA “dark matter” of unknown function. We use transcriptomic technologies to discover and understand the features and functions of these noncoding RNAs. Specifically, our lab studies how RAS signaling regulates the expression and secretion of the noncoding transcriptome during the earliest stages of development and cancer. We are leveraging these discoveries to develop non-invasive RNA liquid biopsy technology for precision health and early detection of diseases such as cancer.
  location: UC Santa Cruz

research:
- title: Regulation of transposable elements and RNA secretion
  description: We employ tissue culture models of disease to study how oncogenic signaling like mutant KRAS impact the development of human induced pluripotent stem cells through RNA sequencing, and how these changes in the transcriptome are reflected in the secreted exosomes.

- title: Modeling cancer transcriptomic signatures in the blood plasma of patients
  description: We are studying the viability of RNA-sequencing based cancer tests by training advanced machine larning models on data derived from human blood plasma of patients with cancer towards the development of a non-invasive RNA liquid biopsy technology.
