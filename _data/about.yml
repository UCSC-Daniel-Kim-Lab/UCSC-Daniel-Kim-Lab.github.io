statement: Studying the noncoding transcriptome to develop RNA liquid biopsy technology for precision health and early detection of diseases.
description: Over 75% of the 3 billion base pairs in our genome are transcribed into RNA, yet only 1-2% are translated into proteins. Our lab investigates this noncoding RNA “dark matter” of unknown function. We use transcriptomic technologies to discover and understand the features and functions of these noncoding RNAs. Specifically, our lab studies how RAS signaling regulates the expression and secretion of the noncoding transcriptome during the earliest stages of development and cancer. We are leveraging these discoveries to develop non-invasive RNA liquid biopsy technology for precision health and early detection of diseases such as cancer.
